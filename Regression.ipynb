        "\n",
        "1. ### **Linearity**\n",
        "   - There is a **linear relationship** between the independent variable (\\(X\\)) and the dependent variable (\\(Y\\)).\n",
        "   - You can check this with a scatter plot — the points should roughly form a straight line.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. ### **Independence of Errors**\n",
        "   - The residuals (errors) are **independent** of each other.\n",
        "   - This is especially important in time series data. Violations can be tested with the **Durbin-Watson test**.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. ### **Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance)**\n",
        "   - The variance of residuals should be **constant** across all levels of the independent variable.\n",
        "   - If this is violated, you might see a funnel shape in a residuals vs. fitted values plot.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. ### **Normality of Residuals**\n",
        "   - The residuals (differences between observed and predicted values) should be **normally distributed**.\n",
        "   - You can use a histogram or a Q-Q plot to assess this.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. ### **No or Minimal Multicollinearity** (Only for Multiple Regression)\n",
        "   - While this isn’t a concern in **simple** linear regression (with only one predictor), it's critical when you have more than one independent variable.\n",
