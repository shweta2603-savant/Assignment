        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Encapsulation: This principle involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or object. It also restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which helps protect the integrity of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary features of an object. It allows programmers to interact with objects at a higher level without needing to understand the complexities beneath.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Inheritance: Inheritance allows one class (the child or subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (the parent or superclass). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows methods to be defined in different ways based on the object calling them, facilitating flexibility and the ability to redefine methods in derived classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.Composition: While not always listed as one of the core four principles, composition refers to constructing complex objects by combining simpler ones. It allows for building complex types by using objects of other classes, promoting modularity and flexibility."
