        "The NOT NULL constraint is applied to ensure that a column always contains a value and cannot be left empty. This is crucial when the presence of data in that column is essential for the database to function correctly or to maintain data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reasons to Use NOT NULL:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Data Completeness: Ensures critical information is alwaysrecorded.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: A Name field in a Users table must not be NULL to identify users.\n",

        "\n",
        "No, a primary key cannot contain NULL values Justification:\n",

        "1. Uniqueness Requirement: The primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table. A NULL value represents \"unknown\" or \"missing\" data, which cannot serve as a unique identifier.\n",

        "2. Logical Integrity: The primary key is often used to reference rows in other tables via foreign keys. If a primary key contained NULL, the referenced rows would become ambiguous or invalid.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. SQL Standard: According to SQL standards, the primary key constraint implicitly enforces both NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
